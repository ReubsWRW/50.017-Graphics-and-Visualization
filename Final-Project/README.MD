# Graphics Final Project

Here is the (soon to be) completed code for the final project prototyped in MATLAB 2019 and written in C++ on Visual Studio 2019. 
This program requires Windows SDK version 10.0.16299.0 to run. 

## TO DO

* Graphical visualizations for the quantum wavefunction simulations.

## Running the Executable

Coming soon.

### Simulation Functionalities

Right now, we have a prototype MATLAB code that has an animated visualization of a boundstate wavefunction in an infinite-square well
potential of varying width. The simulation model without graphical visualizations have also been written up in C++. 

## Built With

* [Windows Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) - The IDE.
* [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) - Open source C++ graphics library.
* [Eigen 3.3.7](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) - C++ template library for linear algebra: matrices, vectors, numerical solvers, and related algorithms.
