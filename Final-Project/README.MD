# Assignment 3

Here is the (soon to be) completed code for the final project prototyped in MATLAB and written in C++ on Visual Studio 2019. 
This program requires Windows SDK version 10.0.16299.0 to run. 

## TO DO

* Everything basically.

## Running the Executable

Coming soon.

### Simulation Functionalities

Right now, we have a prototype MATLAB code that has an animated visualization of a boundstate wavefunction in an infinite-square well
potential of varying width. There is also a MATLAB code for the evolution QHO wavefunction but it is not completed.
