# Assignment 1

Here is the completed code for assignment 1 writen in C++ on Visual Studio 2019. 
The additional created artifacts are named "artifact1.swp" and "artifact2.swp". 
This program requires Windows SDK version 10.0.16299.0 to run. 

## TO DO

Extra credit assignments (optional).

## Extra Credit Components

Currently, I have implemented a coloring of the mesh faces based on their normal vectors and ensured alignment of the Frenet-Serret frames for closed trajectory curves based on a "backpropagation" type correction. I have implemented a Catmull-Rom spline method that is able to interpolate the control points. All these are under the easy extra credit assignments.

To view the Catmull-Rom splining results:
```
cd [path]
one.exe swp/catmull_rom_test.swp
```

## Running the Executable

```
cd [path]
one.exe swp/[swp filename].swp
```

where [path] is the file path to the solution folder and [swp filename] is the .swp filename you would like to load into the program.
