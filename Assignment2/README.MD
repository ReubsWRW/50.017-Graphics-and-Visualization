# Assignment 2

Here is the completed code for assignment 2 writen in C++ on Visual Studio 2019. 
As of now, none of the extra credit assignments have been completed or attempted.  
I have added normal-based coloring to the model skin for aesthetic appeal but is not an official extra credit component.
This program requires Windows SDK version 10.0.16299.0 to run. 

## TO DO

Extra credit assignments (optional).

## Extra Credit Components

Have yet to attempt extra credit components.

## Running the Executable

```
cd [path]
a2.exe data/[obj filename]
```

where [path] is the file path to the solution folder and [obj filename] is the .obj filename you would like to load into the program.
