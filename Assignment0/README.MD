# Assignment 0 

Here is the completed code for assignment 0 writen in C++ on Visual Studio 2019. 
This program required Windows SDK version 10.0.16299.0 to run. 
I have added a .h file for all the included libaries and an additional .cpp file for all function definitions.
This was done for organization sake and are named "zero_header.h" and "functions.cpp" respectively. 

## Extra Credit Components

Currently, I have completed up to the medium extra credit components with the exception of smoothening the color toggling. 

## Running the Executable

I am working on Windows 10, so in order to run the zero.exe executable file and load the .obj object file, I used the following commands.

```
cd [path]
zero.exe < [object filename].obj
```
